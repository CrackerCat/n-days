# iOS 18.6.1 0-click RCE POC

The vulnerability seems to be in the Apple's implementation of JPEG Lossless Decompression code which is used inside Adobe's DNG file format. I modified `SamplePerPixel` of the `SubIFD` directory of a DNG to reach the vulnerable function and decreased the `component` count of the `SOF3` block to trigger what seems like an oob write.

`RawCamera.bundle` where all of the vulnerable code lies seems to stripped off symbols so it's hard to explain the code path but I leave that for the reader to figure out. This POC doesn't crash iOS 18.6.2 so I assume it's the same bug :P
